4 How to run this application
This application loads information using the Youtube Data API v3.

To use it, you need to set up a Youtube Data v3 API key and run the project with npm or yarn.

Below, you'll find a step by step explanation

4.1. Getting a Youtube Data API key
Head over to the Google developers console
Create a new project by clicking on Select project drop down right next to the logo. Click the New Project button an give it a speaking name.
Select your project by choosing it in the Select Dropdown directly next to the logo in the header.
Click the Enable APIs and Services button
Search for youtube data
Click on the Youtube Data API v3
Click the blue enable button
In the dashboard, click Credentials on the left sidebar
Click the Create Credential button
Which API are you using: Youtube Data API v3
Where will you be calling the API from: Web browser
What data are you accessing: Public data
Click the What credentials do I need button
Copy the API key
4.2. Providinng the API key to your application
4.2.1 Option 1 - Environment variable (recommended)
Provide your Youtube Data API key with the REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY environment variable.

Create a .env.local file (alread gitignored) with

touch .env.local
and then define the REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY environment variable which is supposed to hold your Youtube Data v3 API key in the .env.local file like so:

REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4.2.2 Option 2 - hardcode API key
As an alternative, you could just hardcode the API key in the src/App.js file.

In general, we'd recommend going with the environment variable approach to prevent you to accidentially commiting the API key go Git.

However, if you do want to hardcode the Youtube Data API key, you can head over to the src/App.js file and paste your API key in:

const API_KEY = 'AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
4.3. Installing dependencies
To install the dependencies run

npm install
With yarn

yarn install
4.4 Running the application
4.4.1 Running locally with local env vars
You can run:

npm run dev
which will source your .env.local file and then start then run npm start.

Note that if you change the value of the .env.local file, you need to run npm run dev again so that the new env var changes are picked up.

As an alternative, you can manually source the .env.local file with

source .env.local
and then run

npm start
You can also use yarn to run the application.

yarn start
If you close the terminal, you will need to source the file again. That's why it is recommended to just run npm run dev so you don't need to think about it.

4.4.2 Running locally with hardcoded Youtube API key
If you copied and pasted the API key directly into the code, you do not need to source anything and you can just run:

npm start
If you are using yarn, you can do

yarn start
Make sure to not commit your file to Git!
